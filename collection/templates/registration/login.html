				 An estimated 4-6 % of people are diagnosed with bipolar disorder throughout the world.  Southern Methodist University (SMU) is conducting a research study to help those affected by bipolar disorder learn to detect and ultimately manage mania through observing changes in the eyes.

		   <h2> About the Study</h2>
		   <p> 
		   	 Bipolar disorder is a genetic illness that affects a personâ€™s ability to self regulate the mood. Episodes of mania and depression, along with anxiety, irritation, focus problems and psychosis are common.  This study seeks to show that mania can be recognized through measurable changes in the eyes. Mania is a difficult to treat mood swing due to the lack of insight inherent in the episode. Specific eye patterns that show mania could be used to help a person in a manic episode recognize the need for help and accept treatment. Pointing out physical changes to the body removes stigma and reinforces the idea that bipolar disorder is a physical illness and not an emotional problem. 
		   </p>
		   <p>
		   The objective of this webpage is to create an anonymous database of pictures of the eyes of people in a manic episode. The research team will then use this information to create an automated process that could be used by people with bipolar disorder, care givers and health care professionals to determine when individuals with bipolar disorder are experiencing manic episodes.

		   <h2>How you can help</h2>
		   <p> 
		  If you have bipolar disorder, we need your photos!  Our goal is to create a database of 1000 photos of the eyes of people in a manic episode. This will help us produce results backed by visible evidence in order to prove our hypothesis.

		   <h2>The Process is Simple</h2>
		   <p> 
		  You will be asked to upload a photo from any time in your life that represents a manic episode. You can also create a photo on your cell phone in the moment to add to the study. All cropping is done online. You will be asked to answer a few questions to help us assess the type of manic episode you were experiencing during the time of the photo as well as questions about medication use. Before submitting your photos, you will be required to read and digitally sign a consent form that is for your protection. All participants in the study must be 18 years of age or older.
