		   <h4> What is this form and what is informed consent?</h4>
		   <p> We are asking you to be in a research study. Before you agree to be in this research study
				you need to read this form. It is important for you to understand all the information in this form
				because it will tell you what the study is about and how it will be done. It will tell you about
				some problems that might happen during the study, as well as the good things that might happen
				during the study. When you read a form like this to learn about a research study, it is called
				“informed consent.” When you give your consent for something, it is identical to giving your
				permission. Please be aware that there is no penalty for refusal to participate and you may
				discontinue participation at any time without penalty. <strong> Do not click “accept” on this consent
				form unless you feel comfortable with the information you have read. </strong>

		   <h4> PURPOSE OF THE STUDY </h4>
		   <p> The objective of this study is to understand how individuals with bipolar disorder
				manifest their symptoms through their eyes. More specifically, we will focus on development of
				an image processing algorithm that can detect manic states based on the appearance of the eyes
				and whether the mania is euphoric (i.e., high energy with positive feelings) or dysphoric (i.e.,
				high energy mixed with a depressed mood and/or anger and agitation). We target mania because
				many times it is difficult to know when someone is experiencing a manic state. As such, an
				algorithm built into a mobile application, for example, can help people understand if they are
				experiencing mania on a physical level and thus can help manage symptoms and increase
				awareness. The image data you provide will help in the design of this algorithm and application.

		   <h4> PROCEDURES </h4>
		   <p> If you decide to participate, we will ask you to upload an image of your eyes and answer
			questions regarding your mental state when the image was taken. These questions are taken from
			the psychology community for understanding if you are in a manic state, neutral state, or
			depressed state when the picture was taken. There are also questions about the use of
			medications and other drug use, which are factors that may affect the detection of mania in the
			eyes. You will <strong>not </strong> be asked to provide your name or other identifying information. We also ask
			that, when you answer questions, you do not provide details that might reveal your identity such
			as your name, address, or other details. Moreover, to keep the process anonymous, we do not
			collect any data about your browser, web history, or where you are located. The picture(s) that
			you upload can be from any camera you wish, such as your smartphone. This website allows you
			to search images from your phone or computer and upload them securely. The website will then
			delete portions of the image that are not your eyes and you will be asked to approve the cropped
			image before submission. Only this cropped image will be saved from the photo you upload.

		    <h4> RISKS, STRESS, OR DISCOMFORT </h4>
		    <p> If you decide to participate, there are some possible risks to be aware, described below. </p>
		    <p>	<strong>Risk 1, Depression. </strong> Survey questions are sometimes personal in nature and may cause you to
				dwell on feelings of depression or mania. In the event that you experience depressive thoughts
				due to the questions, please contact one of the support groups on this web form. These links
				appear at the bottom of every page on this website. 
			</p>
			<p>	<strong>Risk 2, Your Identity. </strong> The researchers involved in this study are committed to keeping your
				identity anonymous. However, it is possible that you could be identified by the images of your
				eyes. Most people cannot be easily identified by images of their eyes because the images are not
				high enough resolution. Even so, if you have unique markings near your eyes such as a birthmark, scar, or mole, you might be able to be identified by these markings. If you are worried
				about being identified or think you might be at higher risk than others for being identified,
				consider not participating in this study. No images from this research study will be released
				publicly. 
			</p>
			<p>	<strong>Risk 3, Third Parties. </strong> It is unethical to upload data from someone else that does not give their
				consent to taking part in this study. There is no direct benefit to people that participate so please
				keep private pictures private. If you are assisting a loved one to upload a picture to this site, your
				loved one must give their consent using this form.

		   <h4> BENEFITS OF THE STUDY </h4>
		   <p> There are no direct benefit to you for participating in this study. Although no incentive will be
				offered for participating in this study, your work will help the larger bipolar disorder community
				find a non invasive way to look for signs of mania in themselves and loved ones. In our
				experiences and research, many individuals who participate in studies then use this new way of
				thinking to further investigate their own symptoms and those of loved ones.
