		   <h4> Q: How will my photos be used? </h4>
		   <p> 
		     <strong>A: </strong> : Accepted photographs will be used to help the team recognize identifiable markers that show signs of mania in the eyes. If specific markers are found, the research team will work together to create an algorithm that could be used to create a computer based application designed to help a person, caregiver or healthcare professional recognize a manic episode. An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem solving operations, especially by a computer. The goal is to show that bipolar disorder mania is part of an illness that can be measured by physical characteristics.
